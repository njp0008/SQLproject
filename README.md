# SQLproject
Practicing some SQL by querying a table in a database I found. 
This table is called "students_performance" and compares the test scores of students (male & female) who took test prep courses as well as seeing if there is a correlation between test scores and the educational background of their parents. Each student is broken into groups based on their parents education level. The
The groups are as follows:
GROUP A: Associate's degree
GROUP B: Bachelor's degree
GROUP C: Some college
GROUP D: High School
GROUP E: Master's Degree

I took some screenshots of the table - keep in mind there are 1000 rows of data so I limited the return to 20. When I write the queries, it still extracts data from all 1000 rows. I want to see if there is a correlation between taking a test prep course vs. not, but also if the educational background of your parent plays a part in the test scores. I picked this dataset because I thought is relevant to the current state of our education system and could open a serious dialogue. The data also includes whether the student recieved a free/reduced rate lunch vs. a standard meal plan. I believe that could play a part in test scores too - poverty has an overwhelming affect on the quality of education.
